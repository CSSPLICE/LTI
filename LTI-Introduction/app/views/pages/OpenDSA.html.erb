      <h1>Add an OpenDSA Exercise or Visualization to Canvas Course</h1>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>
      OpenDSA is an eTextbook project developed at Virginia Tech. OpenDSA
      materials include many visualizations and interactive exercises that
      support courses in a wide variety of Computer Science-related topics such
      as Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), Formal and Programming Languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      OpenDSA currently has two hundred instructional modules, where each
      module is the equivalent to one topic, such as one sorting algorithm.
      Most algorithms and data structure are illustrated by interactive
      algorithm visualizations. Students could enter their own test cases to see
      how the algorithm or data structure works on that input, and they can
      control the pacing of the visualization. Go to the
      <a href="https://opendsa.org" target="_blank"> OpenDSA website</a> to
      read more about OpenDSA.
    </p>
    <p>
      A course instructor who is using the Canvas LMS can add OpenDSA materials
      directly into their Canvas courses. Below are detailed instructions for
      how to add individual OpenDSA exercises or visualization to your Canvas
      course. Gradable exercises will report scores to your Canvas gradebook.
    </p>

    <p>
      To add one or more OpenDSA exercises in your Canvas course, follow the
      following steps:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to
      <a href="http://opendsa.org" target="_blank"> OpenDSA.org </a>
      and create an account.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 2:</strong> Send an email to
      <a href="mailto:opendsa@cs.vt.edu"> opendsa@cs.vt.edu </a>
      and ask for instructor access.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you are provided with the instructor
      access, you need to click on your email address at the top right corner
      of the page and you will be redirected to a page from where you can copy
      your consumer key and a shared secret as shown in the image below:
      <div class="text-center">
        <%= image_tag "OpenDSA/keysecret.png", style:'width:50%' %>
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 4:</strong>
      Next, navigate to your course in Canvas and click the <em>"Settings"</em>
      link in the left sidebar.
      <div class="text-center">
        <%= image_tag "OpenDSA/Canvas1.png", style:'width:40%' %>
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 5:</strong>
      Go to <em>"Apps"</em> and click on <em>"View App Configurations"</em>.
      Note that your institution's version of Canvas might display differently.
      <div class="text-center">
        <%= image_tag "OpenDSA/Canvas2.png", style:'width:40%' %>
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 6:</strong>
      Click on the <em>"+App"</em> button.
      <div class="text-center">
        <%= image_tag "OpenDSA/Canvas3.png", style:'width:40%' %>
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 7:</strong>
      Paste your consumer key and the shared secret that you copied in the
      <em>Step 3</em>. After that, paste
      <a href="https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/lti/xml_config">
        https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/lti/xml_config</a> under
        <em>"Config URL"</em>. This is the URL to the XML configuration for
        OpenDSA.
      <div class="text-center">
        <%= image_tag "OpenDSA/Canvas4.png", style:'width:40%' %>
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 8:</strong> The final configuration for OpenDSA should look
      like the image below. Press <em>"Submit"</em> to add OpenDSA
      as a Tool Provider to Canvas.
      <div class="text-center">
        <%= image_tag "OpenDSA/Canvas5.png", style:'width:30%' %>
      </div>
    </p>
    <br>
    <strong>Now you can insert OpenDSA stand-alone visualization and exercises
      as either graded or ungraded content.</strong> To insert as ungraded
    content follow these steps:<br><br>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 1:</strong>
      Navigate to the Module in your Canvas course where you would like to
      insert the OpenDSA content and click the "+" button to the far right of
      the module's name.
      <div class="text-center">
        <%= image_tag "OpenDSA/module.png", style:'width:40%' %>
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 2:</strong>
      In the dropdown box at the top of the pop-up window, select "External
      Tool". You will see a list of the external tools that are configured for
      your course. Click on the tool labeled <em>OpenDSA</em>.
      <div class="text-center">
        <%= image_tag "OpenDSA/externaltool.png", style:'width:40%' %>
      </div>
    </p><br>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 3:</strong>
      If this is your first time going through this process for your course,
      you will be asked to provide some information that OpenDSA can use to
      identify your course offering. Fill out the required fields and click
      "Submit".
      <div class="text-center">
        <%= image_tag "OpenDSA/info.png", style:'width:30%' %>
      </div>
    </p><br>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 4:</strong>
       Once you do that, a tree view will be displayed listing the topics for
       visualizations and exercises that are available. To expand one of the
       categories, either double click on it, or click the arrow to the left of
       the folder icon. You will then see sub-categories that you can expand.
       Expanding a sub-category will display the names of the exercises and
       visualizations contained within it. Once you find the resource you want
       to add, simply click on it. The "URL" textbox in the Add Module window
       will then be automatically filled in with the URL that will be used to
       launch the resource.
       <div class="text-center">
         <%= image_tag "OpenDSA/exercises.png", style:'width:40%' %>
       </div>
    </p><br>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 5:</strong>
      The new module item will appear under the module name. To make the module
      item viewable by students, click the publish button to the far right of
      the module name (to the immediate left of the gear icon).
      <div class="text-center">
        <%= image_tag "OpenDSA/ungradedmodule.png", style:'width:40%' %>
      </div>
    </p>
    <br><br>

    To insert an OpenDSA exercise as <strong>graded</strong> content follow
    these steps:<br><br>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 1:</strong>
      Navigate to the <em>"Assignments"</em> page in your Canvas course and
      create a new assignment by clicking on <em>"+Assignment"</em> button.
      <div class="text-center">
        <%= image_tag "OpenDSA/assignments.png", style:'width:40%' %>
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 2:</strong>
      Find the input field labeled <em>"Submission Type"</em>. In the dropdown
      box select <em>"External Tool"</em>, then click the button labeled
      <em>"Find"</em> to view the list of available tools.
      <div class="text-center">
        <%= image_tag "OpenDSA/submission_assignment.png", style:'width:30%' %>
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 3:</strong>
      A list of the external tools configured for your course will be
      displayed. Find the tool named <em>"OpenDSA"</em> and click on it to open
      the resource selection window.
      <div class="text-center">
        <%= image_tag "OpenDSA/graded_tools.png", style:'width:30%' %>
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 4:</strong>
      If this is your first time going through this process for your course,
      you will be asked to provide some information that OpenDSA can use to
      identify your course offering. Fill out the required fields and click
      "Submit".
      <div class="text-center">
        <%= image_tag "OpenDSA/info.png", style:'width:30%' %>
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 5:</strong>
       Once you do that, a tree view will be displayed listing the topics
       for visualizations and exercises that are available. To expand one of the
       categories, either double click on it, or click the arrow to the left of
       the folder icon. You will then see sub-categories that you can expand.
       Expanding a sub-category will display the names of the exercises and
       visualizations contained within it. Once you find the resource you want
       to add, simply click on it.
       <div class="text-center">
         <%= image_tag "OpenDSA/exercises.png", style:'width:40%' %>
       </div>
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 6:</strong>
       The URL textbox on the assignment creation page will then be
       automatically filled in with the URL that will be used to launch the
       resource you selected.
       <div class="text-center">
         <%= image_tag "OpenDSA/graded_url.png", style:'width:40%' %>
       </div>
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 7:</strong>
      On the Canvas assignment creation page, specify the number of points the
      assignment will be worth, choose the assignment group, specify a due
      date, and then click <em>"Save and Publish"</em> to make the assignment
      immediately visible to students. Students will see assignments as
      shown here:
      <div class="text-center">
        <%= image_tag "OpenDSA/assignment.png", style:'width:40%' %>
      </div>
    </p>
  </span>
</div>
