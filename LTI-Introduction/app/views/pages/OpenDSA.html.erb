      <h1>OpenDSA - Instructions</h1>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>
      OpenDSA is an eBook project developed at Virginia Tech. OpenDSA materials
      include many visualizations and interactive exercises that support
      courses in a wide variety of Computer Science-related topics such as Data
      Structures and Algorithms (DSA), Formal Languages, Finite Automata, and
      Programming Languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      OpenDSA currently has two hundred instructional modules, where each
      module is the equivalent to one topic, such as one sorting algorithm.
      Every algorithm or data structure is illustrated by an interactive
      algorithm visualization. Students could enter their own test cases to see
      how the algorithm or data structure works on that input, and they can
      control the pacing of the visualization.

    <p>
      To add OpenDSA in your course, you can follow the following steps:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to
      <a href="https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/signup"> this link </a>
      and signup.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 2:</strong> Send an email to
      <a href="mailto:opendsa@cs.vt.edu"> opendsa@cs.vt.edu </a>
      and ask for instructor access.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you are provided with the insturctor
      access, you need to click on your email on top right corner and you will
      be redirected to a page from where you can copy your consumer key and a
      shared secret as shown in the image below:
      <div class="text-center">
        <%= image_tag "OpenDSA/keysecret.png", style:'width:50%' %>
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 4:</strong> Add OpenDSA as a Tool provider to your LMS with
      your consumer key, shared secret and XML configuration from
      <a href="https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/lti/xml_config">
        https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/lti/xml_config</a>
      <div class="text-center">
        <%= image_tag "OpenDSA/addtool.png", style:'width:30%' %>
      </div>
    </p>
    <br>

    <strong>Now you can either insert OpenDSA as either graded or ungraded
      content.</strong> To insert as ungraded content follow the following
      steps:<br><br>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 1:</strong>
      Navigate to the Module in your Canvas course that you would like to
      insert the OpenDSA content and click the "+" button to the far right of
      the module's name.
      <div class="text-center">
        <%= image_tag "OpenDSA/module.png", style:'width:40%' %>
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 2:</strong>
      In the dropdown box at the top of the pop-up window, select "External
      Tool". You will see a list of the external tools that are configured for
      your course.
      <div class="text-center">
        <%= image_tag "OpenDSA/externaltool.png", style:'width:40%' %>
      </div>
    </p><br>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 3:</strong>
      Click on the tool labeled OpenDSA and if this is your first time going
      through this process for your course, you will be asked to provide some
      information that OpenDSA can use to identify your course offering. Fill
      out the required fields and click "Submit".
      <div class="text-center">
        <%= image_tag "OpenDSA/info.png", style:'width:30%' %>
      </div>
    </p><br>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 4:</strong>
       Once you do that, a tree view will be displayed listing the categories
       of visualizations and exercises that are available. To expand one of the
       categories, either double click on it, or click the arrow to the left of
       the folder icon. You will then see sub-categories that you can expand.
       Expanding a sub-category will display the names of the exercises and
       visualizations contained within it. Once you find the resource you want
       to add, simply click on it. The "URL" textbox in the Add Module window
       will then be automatically filled in with the url that will be used to
       launch the resource.
       <div class="text-center">
         <%= image_tag "OpenDSA/exercises.png", style:'width:40%' %>
       </div>
    </p><br>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 5:</strong>
      The new module item will appear under the module name. To make the module
      item viewable by students, click the publish button to the far right of
      the module name (to the immediate left of the gear icon).
      <div class="text-center">
        <%= image_tag "OpenDSA/ungradedmodule.png", style:'width:40%' %>
      </div>
    </p>
    <br><br>

    To insert OpenDSA as <strong>graded</strong> content follow the following
    steps:<br><br>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 1:</strong>
      Navigate to the "Assignments" page in your Canvas course and create a new
      assignment.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 2:</strong>
      Find the input field labeled "Submission Type". In the dropdown box
      select "External Tool", then click the button labeled "Find".

    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 3:</strong>
      A list of the external tools configured for your course will be
      displayed. Find the tool named "OpenDSA" and click on it to open the
      resource selection window.
      <div class="text-center">
        <%= image_tag "OpenDSA/graded_tools.png", style:'width:30%' %>
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 4:</strong>
      If this is your first time going through this process for your course,
      you will be asked to provide some information that OpenDSA can use to
      identify your course offering. Fill out the required fields and click
      "Submit".
      <div class="text-center">
        <%= image_tag "OpenDSA/info.png", style:'width:30%' %>
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 5:</strong>
       Once you do that, a tree view will be displayed listing the categories
       of visualizations and exercises that are available. To expand one of the
       categories, either double click on it, or click the arrow to the left of
       the folder icon. You will then see sub-categories that you can expand.
       Expanding a sub-category will display the names of the exercises and
       visualizations contained within it. Once you find the resource you want
       to add, simply click on it.
       <div class="text-center">
         <%= image_tag "OpenDSA/exercises.png", style:'width:40%' %>
       </div>
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 6:</strong>
       The url textbox on the assignment creation page will then be
       automatically filled in with the url that will be used to launch the
       resource you selected.
       <div class="text-center">
         <%= image_tag "OpenDSA/graded_url.png", style:'width:40%' %>
       </div>
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 7:</strong>
      On the Canvas assignment creation page, specify the number of points the
      assignment will be worth, choose the assignment group, and specify a due
      date and click "Save and Publish" to make the assignment immediately
      visible to students. Students will view assignments as following
      <div class="text-center">
        <%= image_tag "OpenDSA/assignment.png", style:'width:40%' %>
      </div>
    </p>
  </span>
</div>
