      <h1>Configure an OpenDSA eTextbook</h1>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>
      OpenDSA is an eTextbook project developed at Virginia Tech. OpenDSA
      materials include many visualizations and interactive exercises that
      support courses in a wide variety of Computer Science-related topics such
      as Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), Formal and Programming Languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      OpenDSA has hundreds of visualizations and exercises.
      Most algorithms and data structures are illustrated by interactive
      algorithm visualizations. Students could enter their own test cases to see
      how the algorithm or data structure works on that input, and they can
      control the pacing of the visualization. Go to the
      <a href="https://opendsa.org" target="_blank"> OpenDSA website</a> to
      read more about OpenDSA.
    </p>
    <p>
      A course instructor who is using the Canvas LMS can add OpenDSA materials
      directly into their Canvas courses appearing as Modules and Assignments
      in Canvas. Below are the detailed instructions for how to configure an
      OpenDSA eTextbook.
    </p>

    <p>
      To configure a new eTextbook, click on the <em>Create
      Book</em> menu item located at the top of the page.
      <div class="text-center">
        <%= image_tag "OpenDSA/BookInstance14-1.png", style:'width:60%' %>
      </div>
      <br>
      You will be taken to a new page (shown below) where you can create your
      own Book Instance.
      <div class="text-center">
        <%= image_tag "OpenDSA/BookInstance14-2.png", style:'width:30%' %>
      </div>
      <br>
      Following is the explanation of each field:<br>
      <h3>Load Existing Configuration (Optional)</h3>
      <p>1. <strong>Select Reference Configuration:</strong> You may select
        from a number of configuration files that are stored on the OpenDSA
        server. These can be useful as a starting point for creating your own
        configuration.</p>
      <p>2. <strong>Select Your Configuration:</strong> If you have
        created/uploaded a configuration to the OpenDSA server in the past, you
        may load it and make modifications to it. If you only wish to change
        the point values of the exercises in the book, you may update the
        existing configuration directly. If you wish to modify the content of
        the book (e.g. add or remove modules), you must save your configuration
        as a new template book.</p>
      <p>3. <strong>Select Configuration File:</strong> If you have a book
        configuration file (.json), you may load it using this option.</p>

      <h3>Book settings</h3>
      <p>These are global settings that describe or apply to the entire book.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Title:</strong> This will be the title of the book</li>
        <li><strong>Description:</strong> A short description of the book</li>
        <li><strong>Language:</strong> The language of the content in the book.
          This will determine which modules are available for you to choose
          from. The vast majority of OpenDSA content is currently only
          available in English.</li>
        <li><strong>Code Languages:</strong> OpenDSA modules sometimes contain
          sample code. You may select which languages you wish for these code
          samples to appear in. If you select multiple languages, the code
          sample container will have a tab for each language (unless you
          disable Tabbed Code-include), with the tabs ordered based on how you
          order the languages in the interface. You may reorder the languages
          using drag-and-drop. It is important to note that code samples are
          usually not available in every language, but most code samples are
          available in Java.</li>
        <li><strong>Global Exercise Options:</strong> These are options that
          will apply to every exercise.
          <ul>
            <li>JSAV Debug: This option can be useful for developers of OpenDSA
              exercises. It enables the debug flag for JSAV exercises, which
              results in some debugging information being printed to the
              browser console.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Global Slideshow Options:</strong> These options will apply
          to all slideshows, unless explicitly overridden for individual
          slideshows. Note that these generally should not be changed from Not
          Required and 0 Points if you are planning to use the configuration
          for a Canvas course. This is due to current limitations preventing
          multiple gradable items per Canvas assignment.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Required: Whether the completion of the slideshow is required for
              module proficiency.
            </li>
            <li>
              Points: The number of points completion of the slideshow is
              worth.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Global Khan-Academy Exercise Options:</strong> These are
          options that will apply to all Khan-Academy style exercises, unless
          explicitly overridden for individual exercises.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Required: Whether the completion of the exercise is required for
              module proficiency.
            </li>
            <li>
              Points: The number of points the exercise is worth.
            </li>
            <li>
              Threshold: The number of questions the student must get correct
              to achieve proficiency.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Global Proficiency Exercise Options:</strong> These are
          options that will apply to all proficiency style exercises, unless
          explicitly overridden for individual exercises.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Required: Whether the completion of the exercise is required for
              module proficiency.
            </li>
            <li>
              Points: The number of points the exercise is worth.
            </li>
            <li>
              Threshold: The proportion of steps the student must get correct to
              achieve proficiency. Must be between 0 and 1, where 1 means the
              student must get all steps correct to achieve proficiency.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Global External Tool Options:</strong> These are options that
          will apply to all external tool exercises unless the same settings
          are specified for the specific external tool, or overridden for a
          specific external tool exercise.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Points: The number of points the exercise is worth.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Global Code-Workout Options:</strong> These are options that
          will apply to all Code-Workout exercises, unless explicitly overridden
          for individual exercises.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Points: The number of points the exercise is worth.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Other Options:</strong> These are simple options that are
          either enabled or disabled.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Build JSAV: Controls whether or not the JSAV library should be
              rebuilt whenever the book is compiled.
            </li>
            <li>
              Display Module Completion: If enabled, will force the "Module
              Complete" message to appear even if the module contains no
              required exercises. If disabled, the "Module Complete" message
              will not appear, even if the module DOES contain required
              exercises.
            </li>
            <li>
              Narration Enabled: This controls whether or not a button should
              be shown for each slideshow that will turn on text-to-speech
              narration for that slideshow.</li>
              <li>
                Suppress ToDo: Controls whether or not TODO messages are
                displayed. This should generally be enabled.
              </li>
              <li>
                Tabbed Code-include: Controls whether or not code samples are
                displayed in a tabbed interface. If enabled, it will display
                code samples in each of the languages selected in Code
                Languages section (if the code exists) in a tabbed container.
                If disabled, it will display the code in a single language (the
                first language for which the code exists with the order of
                precedence determined by the order specified in the Code
                Languages section).
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Book Content</h3>
